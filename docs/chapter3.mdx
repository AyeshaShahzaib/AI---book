## The Brain as Inspiration

Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure of the human brain. This chapter explores the architecture of neural networks and the rise of deep learning.

## A Simple Neural Network

A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized in layers.
