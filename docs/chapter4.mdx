## Understanding Human Language

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This chapter explores the challenges and breakthroughs in NLP.

## The NLP Pipeline

A typical NLP pipeline involves several stages, from tokenization to semantic analysis.

## Key Concepts

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** A field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language.
*   **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down a text into individual words or tokens.
*   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** The task of identifying and classifying named entities in a text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.
