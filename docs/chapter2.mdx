## Learning from Data

Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of machine learning and its impact on the world.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

## Key Concepts

*   **Supervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where the model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.
