## The Dawn of a New Era

The concept of artificial intelligence is not a new one. For centuries, humans have been fascinated by the idea of creating intelligent machines. This chapter explores the early history of AI, from its philosophical roots to the first computational models.

## The Pioneers

Let's meet some of the key figures who laid the groundwork for the AI revolution.

## Key Concepts

*   **Turing Test:** A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
*   **LISP:** A family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
*   **Deep Learning:** A class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.
