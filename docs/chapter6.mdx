## Learning by Doing

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. This chapter explores the principles and applications of reinforcement learning.

## The Reinforcement Learning Cycle

The reinforcement learning process involves an agent, an environment, an action, a state, and a reward.

## Key Concepts

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.
*   **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.
*   **Environment:** The world in which the agent operates.
